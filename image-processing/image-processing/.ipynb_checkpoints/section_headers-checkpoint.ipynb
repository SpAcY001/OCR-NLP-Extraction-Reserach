      "Your shares will be subscribed to and held on your behalf via an employee shareholding fund, a French collective shareholding vehicle known as a Fonds Commun de Placement d'Entreprise (the \"FCPE\"), which is commonly used in France to hold and manage shares held by employees under employee share plans.

      "It is an Employee Shareholding Fund governed by the French Monetary and Financial Code. Its sole purpose is to hold shares for employee shareholders in plans such as the Schneider Electric WESOP. Both FCPEs, \"Schneider Relais International 2024\" and \"Schneider Actionnariat Mondial\", are invested almost exclusively in Schneider Electric SE shares. The FCPE is divided into units of equal value, and each of these units represents an interest in the shares held by the FCPE. Unlike shares, the units are not transferable and cannot be listed on a stock exchange market. The FCPE is controlled by a Supervisory Board made up of at least 50% of representatives of Schneider Electric employees who will hold all units in the fund and 50% of representatives of Schneider Electric management. \n",

Dividends, if any, will be reinvested when declared in the \"Schneider Actionnariat Mondial\" FCPE and increase the value of each unit. \n",

      "If you subscribe to the 2024 WESOP, on the date of the capital increase, you will be issued units in the \"Schneider Relais International 2024\" FCPE corresponding to the Schneider Electric SE shares subscribed, and, after the merger between the two FCPEs, units of the \"Schneider Actionnariat Mondial\" FCPE (the \"Classic FCPE\"). \n",

      "For so long as the shares are held in the Plan, Schneider Electric SE reserves the right, to the extent permitted by law, to amend or change the custody arrangements, including by transferring the shares held under the FCPE to a nominative account. Such amendment, change, or transfer may affect the manner in which your shareholder rights are exercised. \n",

Before relying on or attempting to rely on any of these Early Exit Events, you should consult with your Employer to ensure that your case meets all the requirements of the International Employee Shareholding Plan (IESP) and is permitted under local laws. You should not conclude that an Early Exit Event is applicable unless you have described your specific situation to your Employer and your Employer has confirmed that it applies to your situation upon providing the requisite supporting documents.
